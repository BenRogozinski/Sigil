## Features

- Flexible hosting options
- Improved compatibility over UV-Static
- Automatic link rotation

## Deployment
[Put hosting buttons here, TBD]

Note: This project can also be hosted on **any** static hosting service, including locally hosted, as long as it provides a working HTTPS connection. Trying to host this on an HTTP connection will result in errors with service workers.
